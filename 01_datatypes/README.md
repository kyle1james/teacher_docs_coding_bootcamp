1. [Intro](#strings)
2. [Lab](#lab)



## Intro

First, code the following. Have students wait until you are done to do the same but for their name.

```python
print('hello Kyle')
```

Awesome, now while this great, it can get very boring very quick. Imagine you have to say hello to 1000 people. Who wants to write 1000's hello's!? There has got to be a better way.

```python
name = 'Kyle'
print('hello '+ name)
```

- have students predict what will happen
- ask students what name did?

Very cool, name is a variable. In computer science, a variable stores some sort of information. Think of a variable like a magic box. When we look inside the box, we see what data is inside.

When we use words in quotes, we call this a string.

Let's code a few variables together. Ask students, make sure to stay with string datatypes!

```python
name = 'Kyle'
food = 'Pizza'

print('hello my name is '+name+'and I love '+ food)
```

Run the program and change the variables based on students in the class.

## Go to Lab One
Today you are going to create a madlib program.
